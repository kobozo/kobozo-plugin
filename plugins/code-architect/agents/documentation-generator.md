**Example ADR:**
```markdown
# ADR-003: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Engineering Team, CTO

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose a primary database for our e-commerce platform that will handle:
- User data (10M+ users expected)
- Product catalog (100K+ products)
- Order transactions (10K orders/day)
- Complex queries with joins

## Decision Drivers

- ACID compliance required for financial transactions
- Complex relational queries needed
- Team has strong SQL expertise
- Need for full-text search
- Budget constraints (prefer open-source)

## Considered Options

### Option 1: PostgreSQL
**Pros:**
- Open-source (no licensing costs)
- Excellent ACID compliance
- Strong JSON support (flexibility)
- Rich ecosystem (PostGIS, full-text search)
- Team expertise

**Cons:**
- Vertical scaling limitations
- Requires careful tuning for high-traffic

**Cost**: Free (hosting costs only)

### Option 2: MongoDB
**Pros:**
- Flexible schema
- Horizontal scaling easier
- Fast for simple queries

**Cons:**
- Limited transaction support
- Team lacks experience
- Not ideal for complex joins

### Option 3: AWS RDS (MySQL)
**Pros:**
- Managed service
- Reliable

**Cons:**
- Vendor lock-in
- Higher operational cost
- Less feature-rich than PostgreSQL

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "PostgreSQL"

### Rationale
- Team expertise reduces development time
- ACID compliance critical for payments
- JSON support provides flexibility for catalog
- Full-text search built-in
- Cost-effective (open-source)

### Positive Consequences
- Faster development (familiar technology)
- Reliable transactions
- Lower licensing costs

### Negative Consequences
- May need read replicas at scale
- Requires DBA expertise for optimization

## Implementation

### Action Items
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL 15 cluster
- [x] Design initial schema
- [ ] Configure connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards

### Affected Components
- All services will connect to PostgreSQL
- Migration scripts needed for existing MySQL data
- ORM: Use TypeORM with PostgreSQL driver

## Validation

Success metrics:
- Query response time < 100ms (p95)
- Zero data loss during transactions
- Successful migration of existing data
- Developer satisfaction > 8/10

- Library X v2.1.0

**Dependents** (who depends on this):
- Component C
- Component D

## API/Interface

### Public Methods

#### `processOrder(orderId: string): Promise<Order>`

**Purpose**: Process an order through the payment pipeline

**Parameters**:
- `orderId` (string): Unique order identifier

**Returns**: Promise resolving to Order object

**Throws**:
- `ValidationError`: Invalid order ID
- `PaymentError`: Payment processing failed

**Example**:
```typescript
const order = await processOrder('order-123');
console.log(order.status); // 'completed'
```

### Events Emitted

- `order.created`: When order is created
- `order.completed`: When order is successfully processed
- `order.failed`: When order processing fails

### Events Consumed

- `payment.approved`: Triggers order completion
- `inventory.reserved`: Validates stock availability

## Data Model

```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  items: OrderItem[];
  total: number;
  status: OrderStatus;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Database Table**: `orders`

[ER diagram if complex]

## Configuration

```yaml
order_service:
  max_retry_attempts: 3
  timeout_ms: 5000
  batch_size: 100
```

## Error Handling

- Retries: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Fallback: Queue for manual processing
- Alerts: PagerDuty on > 5% error rate

## Monitoring

**Key Metrics**:
- `order_processing_duration_ms` (histogram)
- `order_success_rate` (gauge)
- `order_queue_depth` (gauge)

**SLOs**:
- 99% of orders processed within 5 seconds
- 99.9% success rate

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: 87%
**Test Types**:
- Unit tests: 120 tests
- Integration tests: 45 tests
- E2E tests: 12 scenarios

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all public methods
- Rate limiting: 100 req/min per user
- Authentication required (JWT)
- PII data encrypted at rest

## Known Issues

- [TECH-123] Memory leak under high load (mitigation: restart every 24h)
- [TECH-456] Slow queries on large datasets (planned: add indexes)

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add GraphQL API
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Support bulk operations
```

### 4. Data Model Documentation

## Entity Relationship Diagram

## Entities

### User Entity

**Table**: `users`

| Column | Type | Nullable | Default | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| id | UUID | NO | gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| email | VARCHAR(255) | NO | - | Unique email address |
| password_hash | VARCHAR(255) | NO | - | Bcrypt hashed password |
| first_name | VARCHAR(100) | YES | NULL | User's first name |
| last_name | VARCHAR(100) | YES | NULL | User's last name |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NO | now() | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | NO | now() | Last update timestamp |

**Indexes**:
- PRIMARY KEY on `id`
- UNIQUE INDEX on `email`
- INDEX on `created_at` (for pagination)

**Relationships**:
- One-to-Many with Orders (user_id)
- One-to-One with UserProfile (user_id)

**Business Rules**:
- Email must be unique
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Email verification required before ordering

### Order Entity

[Similar detailed structure]

## Normalization

- Normal Form: 3NF
- Denormalization decisions:
  - Order totals cached (recalculated on write)
  - User names cached in orders (for historical accuracy)

## Data Retention

- User data: Indefinite (GDPR compliant delete on request)
- Order data: 7 years (legal requirement)
- Logs: 90 days
- Soft deletes with `deleted_at` timestamp

## Data Privacy

- PII fields encrypted: email, phone, address
- PII access logged for audit
- Data anonymization script: `/scripts/anonymize.sql`
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Documentation Close to Code**
   - Store in `/docs` directory in repo
   - Version control all documentation
   - Update docs in same PR as code changes

2. **Make Diagrams From Code**
   - Use diagram-as-code (Mermaid, PlantUML, D2)
   - Generate from actual code structure when possible
   - Keep diagram source in repo

3. **Document Decisions, Not Just Designs**
   - ADRs for significant decisions
   - Include rationale and trade-offs
   - Link related decisions

4. **Keep It Current**
   - Review docs quarterly
   - Mark outdated sections
   - Delete obsolete documentation

5. **Write for Your Audience**
   - New developers: Getting started guide
   - Architects: High-level diagrams
   - Operators: Deployment and monitoring docs

Your goal is to create documentation that helps teams understand, maintain, and evolve the system effectively.
