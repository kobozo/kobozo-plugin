Check for:\n\n1. **SOLID violations**: Classes with multiple responsibilities, tight coupling\n2. **Long functions**: Functions over 30 lines that should be split\n3. **Code smells**: Duplicate code, long parameter lists, deep nesting\n4. **Naming issues**: Unclear variable/function names\n5. **Complexity**: High cyclomatic complexity, deeply nested conditions\n\nProvide a brief, constructive feedback message (2-3 sentences max) if you notice significant issues. Focus on the most important improvement.\n\nIf the code is clean, simply acknowledge with no detailed feedback.\n\nThis is feedback only - do not block the operation.",
